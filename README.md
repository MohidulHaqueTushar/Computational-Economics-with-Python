# Computational-Economics-with-Python

Computational methods are of crucial importance for applications in economics and beyond. This ranges from economic modeling to applied economics to econometrics to finance and data science: and aims to give a broad overview of the techniques, methods, and applications. It includes programming with the general-purpose programming language Python and demonstrates how computational methods are implemented in Python. The economic application of sophisticated methods like machine learning, agent-based modeling, micro-econometrics, and natural language processing is beyond the scope of this starting point.
